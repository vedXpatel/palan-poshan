**Problem Statement:**<br>
Malnourishment remains one of India's major problems, afflicting 40% of the children born. AWW tries to assist mothers to give birth to a healthy child with a normal growth spurt. However, due to lack of support and help, AWW is unable to provide the mothers with the right counsel. They need a platform that will provide them with the information to be conveyed and for FMCH to monitor this processM

**Solution:** <br>
1.  To reach the proper counsel, we have a decision tree that will take barely 30 seconds for the AWW to fill. <br>
2.  We have dashboards for FMCH workers and AWWs to track the AWWs and mothers respectively. <br>
3.  We have an appointments page to help track AWWs work for the day. <br>
4.  We have articles that AWWs can refer to, for providing the proper counsel additionally. <br>
